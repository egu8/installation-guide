===================================

Hi, this is the installation guide for GT Big Data Club. It contains instructions on how to install everything that you need to start hacking with us. This guide is separated by the different layers of our application (ui, clusterer, and crawling) and by OS (Windows and Mac OSX). So, check out the section that your interested in, grab a soda, and start installing.


General
-------
There are certain tools and technologies that all parts of the team interact with. These are:

#### git:
A free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

##### Windows
The easiest way to get Git installed is by installing GitHub for Windows. The installer includes a command line version of Git as well as the GUI. It also works well with Powershell.You can download this from the GitHub for Windows [website](http://windows.github.com).


##### Mac OSX
There are several ways to install Git on a Mac. The easiest is probably to install the Xcode Command Line Tools. On Mavericks (10.9) or above you can do this simply by trying to run git from the Terminal the very first time. If you donâ€™t have it installed already, it will prompt you to install it.

An OSX Git installer is maintained and available for download at the Git [website](http://git-scm.com/download/mac).

You can also install it as part of the GitHub for Mac install. Their GUI Git tool has an option to install command line tools as well. You can download that tool from the GitHub for Mac [website](http://mac.github.com).
